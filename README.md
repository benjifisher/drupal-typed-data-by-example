# Drupal's Typed Data API by example

This repository aims to help show use cases and various exercises with using Drupal's [Typed Data API](https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/api/typed-data-api/typed-data-api-overview). 

> The Typed Data API was created to provide developers with a consistent way of interacting with data in different ways.

## Trying it out!

All of the examples can be run to see sample outputs.

For example, the following will run the `emails` example in `strings` and print any of the additional output provided for context.

```bash
php strings/email.php
```
